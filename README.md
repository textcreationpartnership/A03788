      * Whoſoeuer will receiue the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ, ought to know how to anſwere to the fiue queſtions folowing.

    _ ¶ If the ſicke body be any thing rich, then a body may bee the more earneſt and diligent, to exhort them to almes giuing: but ſo, that the ſicke perſon be not perſuaded to put truſt in his owne workes, and bring him into a vaine hope, that he ſhal purchaſe heauen by his almes. Therefore conſideration muſt be had to the ſoule, that it be not lead out of the right way, into the way that is full of briers and thornes.

    _ ¶ If the ſickneſſe do linger and driue off, ſo that the patient be aſſaulted with grieuous ſickneſſe, then may a body ſometime ſhewe him of theſe comforts following, and alwayes declare one comfort or two. For like as a body muſt nowe and then releeue the ſicke body, with comfortable medicines, and brothes: likewiſe ſhal now and then releeue and quicken the ſoule, whereby the ſoule may haue her ſuſtenaunce. And yet we ſhall not be tedious to the ſicke, and make him haue no delight, or be offended in his head, and euer to haue regard, whether he be troubled with any temptation, and whether he haue a deſire and
 luſt to heare Gods word: for the ſicke muſt haue his eaſe and quietneſſe. So that with too much reading and crying vpon him, ye bring him into raging, or paſſions, and make his head ydle, feeble, and weake. Herein ought euery body to vſe diſcretion, and put difference.

      * Whoſoeuer will receiue the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ, ought to know how to anſwere to the fiue queſtions folowing.

    _ ¶ Hereafter followe certeine prayers, whiche may be ſaid before the ſicke body, if the ſickneſſe haue any continuance, whereby ſometime the ſicke bodies heart may be touched, moued, and kindled, that the ſickneſſe may not preuaile, and haue the ouerhand vpon the ſicke.

    _ If it pleaſe any man to ſay all the whole Pſalms, to be ſaid to the ſicke, I will not complaine vppon him. Therfore they that liſt may when he liſt ſometime take theſe Pſalmes hereafter following, and read the ſame to the ſicke, and ſometime make ſome ſhorte rehearſall of them, and with them comfort the ſicke body, ſpecially the 25. 51. 70. 71. 77. 87. 88. 103. 130. &c. And if neede require, a man may often repeate them or take ſome comfortable part of them, and alſo like comfortable ſayinges out of my litle booke, called The ſpiritual conflict, all which for ſhortneſſe I leaue heere vntouched.

      * Whoſoeuer will receiue the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ, ought to know how to anſwere to the fiue queſtions folowing.

    _ Fiftly, if the partie lye long in a traunce: For I haue many times ſeene, that ſome haue lyen a long time (as it were) in a traunce, and afterward haue begunne againe to ſpeake, and haue ſaid, that they very well heard and did vnderſtand what hath then beene ſaid vnto them. Therefore they that will, may rehearſe
 to the ſicke, this ſhort expoſition of our beleefe.

    _ ¶ If any be diſpoſed, they may rehearſe againe to
 the ſicke, the twelue Articles of our beleefe, for they be the very ancor, yea, the very foundation of our beleefe, which wee can neuer ſufficiently meditate and thinke vpon. It is therefore very meete and neceſſarie, ſeeing in our youth wee bee baptiſed in them, that wee continually be fed with them: then ſhall wee ioyfully die in them. It were very good that we ſhould alwayes in time of our health remember them, and learne perfectly to vnderſtande them. Then, when we lye on our death bed, we ſhall not ſo much neede to be put in remembraunce. And if a man ready to die in time of neede (ſpecially if death come ſoudenly vpon him) confeſſe no more but the onely articles of our true and auncient faith, and Chriſtian religion, it were ſufficient, ſpecialy if thoſe articles were holden and profeſſed by him that lyeth dying with a faithfull heart. For we hope, yea, we earneſtly beleeue, that our beloued anceſtors, in the great darknes, though they knew nothing of the brightneſſe of Gods holy light and knowledge, and yet confeſſed and dyed in this Chriſtian beleefe, and haue inioyed euerlaſting life: Therfore ſhall we beſtowe our poſsible diligence, to bring young children to be baptiſed, thoſe that be elder to be taught, and thoſe that bee at the point of death to be comforted, euery man according to his meaſure and gift, wherby (as much as lyeth in vs,) no body ſhall bee taken tarde, be vnprouided, or dye in his errour
 and vnbeleefe. But ſo to vſe our ſelues, that euery body may come vnto the knowledge of the truth, be bleſſed, and ſaued, and ſo at the laſt, commend in our prayer euery man one with an other vnto God, which can mightily bring to paſſe al that we deſire or require according to his power that worketh in vs. To him be prayſe in the congregation, which is in Chriſte Ieſus, for euer and euer. Amen.
